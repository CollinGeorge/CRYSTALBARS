# CRYSTAL BARS™

CRYSTAL BARS™ is an artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capability that enables the prediction of a chosen financial securities direction of movement with a minimum of 80% accuracy. This is accomplished through the analysis of qualitative data using open source intelligence (OSINT) to quantify market sentiment. Additionally, quantitative analysis is performed using historical liquidity data to measure individual candlesticks (bars), accumulation, distribution, consolidation, and time to identify patterns and correlations.

Using both qualitative and quantitative data analysis, the prediction model (CRYSTAL BARS™) will output within minutes to several hours the direction of a chosen financial security. It should be noted CRYSTAL BARS™ is not intended for and does not work in dark pool or high frequency trading (HFT). CRYSTAL BARS™ is intended for intraday and short term swing trading.
