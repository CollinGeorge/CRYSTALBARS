# CRYSTAL BARS™

CRYSTAL BARS™ is an artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capability that enables the prediction of a chosen financial securities direction of movement with an minimum of 80% accuracy. This is achieved through the analysis of qualitative data using open source intelligence (OSINT) to quantify market sentiment. Additionally, quantatitive analysis is performed using historical liquidity data to measure individual candlesticks (bars), accumulation, distribution and time to identify patterns, correlations. 

Using both qualitative and quantative data and analysis, CRYSTAL BARS™ prediction model will output within minutes to several hours the direction of a chosen financial security.
