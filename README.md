# CRYSTAL BARS™

CRYSTAL BARS™ is an artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning(ML) capability that enables the prediction of a chosen financial security. This is achieved through the analysis of qualitative data using open source intelligence (OSINT) to quantify market sentiment. Additionally, quantitive analysis is performed using historical liquidity data to measure individual candlesticks (bars), accumulation, distribution and time to identify patterns, correlations and assist in the prediction of a securities direction of movement over a given time period. 

Using both qualitative and qualitative data and analysis, CRYSTAL BARS™ prediction model will output within minutes to several hours the direction of a chosen financial security with a minimum of 80% accuracy. It should be noted this particular capability is not meant and DOES NOT work in dark pool or high frequency trading (HFT). CRYSTAL BARS™ is intended for intraday and short term swing trading. Below is a rudimentary example and general framework  of how CRYSTAL BARS™ functions
